## Overview

This Go library provides a simple JSON parser that tokenizes a JSON string and parses it into Go data structures. It supports JSON objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null values. The parser is lightweight and suitable for basic JSON processing.

## Key Features

- Tokenization: Converts a JSON string into individual tokens, such as {, }, [, ], ,, and :.

- Parsing: Supports parsing JSON objects and arrays into Go maps and slices, respectively.

- Primitive Types: Handles numbers (integers), booleans (true/false), strings and null.

- Error Tolerance: Handles common syntax issues gracefully.

## Limitations and Known Issues

- No Floating Point Numbers: The parser currently supports integers but does not handle floating-point numbers.

- Limited Error Handling: Syntax errors are not explicitly reported; instead, the parser just return nil without more info.

- No Escape Characters: Special characters within strings (like \ or \n) are not supported.

## Usage and Testing

Example of a CLI tool:

```go
func main() {
	if len(os.Args) != 2 {
		fmt.Println("Usage: go run main.go <filename>")
		return
	}
	content, _ := os.ReadFile(os.Args[1])
	tokens := jsonparser.Tokenize(string(content))
	result, _ := jsonparser.Parse(tokens)

	// Pretty print the result
	prettyJSON, err := json.MarshalIndent(result, "", "  ")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Failed to generate JSON:", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println(string(prettyJSON))
}
```

You can also find a `main.go` file in the `example` folder implementing a CLI tool to parse JSON using this library.
