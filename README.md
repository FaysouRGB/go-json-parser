## Overview

This Go library provides a simple JSON parser that tokenizes a JSON string and parses it into Go data structures. It supports JSON objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null values. The parser is lightweight and suitable for basic JSON processing.

## Key Features

- Tokenization: Converts a JSON string into individual tokens, such as {, }, [, ], ,, and :.

- Parsing: Supports parsing JSON objects and arrays into Go maps and slices, respectively.

- Primitive Types: Handles numbers (integers), booleans (true/false), strings and null.

- Error Tolerance: Handles common syntax issues gracefully.

## Limitations and Known Issues

- No Floating Point Numbers: The parser currently supports integers but does not handle floating-point numbers.

- Limited Error Handling: Syntax errors are not explicitly reported; instead, the parser just return nil without more info.

- No Escape Characters: Special characters within strings (like \ or \n) are not supported.

## Usage and Testing

You can find a CLI tool in the `cmd/jsonparser/main.go` showcasing how easy the library is to use.

## Contributions and Feedback
